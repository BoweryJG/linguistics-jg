# Changes Made

## Frontend Backend Connection Verification

The frontend is successfully configured to connect to the backend at `https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com`. The connection is established through:

1. Environment variable in `.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com
```

2. API module configuration in `src/api.js`:
- Uses the environment variable to set the base URL
- Implements proper error handling and retry logic
- Includes CORS proxy fallback for cross-origin requests
- Handles authentication through Supabase

3. Test scripts created:
- `test-backend-connection.js`: Basic connection test to various endpoints
- `test-api-connection.js`: More comprehensive test of API functionality

## Key Findings

1. The API connection is properly configured
2. The application includes fallback mechanisms for when the API is unavailable
3. Supabase integration is configured properly for authentication and storage

## Next Steps

- Ensure all API calls include proper error handling
- Consider implementing usage metrics tracking
- Add unit tests for API functions
