# mUiLinguistics Frontend - Backend Connection Changes

## Summary of Changes

The frontend has been successfully configured to connect to the backend at `https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com`. The following changes have been made:

1. Verified the environment configuration in `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com
   ```

2. Confirmed API connection configuration in `src/api.js`:
   - The API_URL is properly loaded from environment variables
   - The `isOsBackend` flag is set to `false` to ensure real API calls are made
   - Request handling includes proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. Created testing tools:
   - `test-backend-connection.js`: Tests direct connectivity to the backend
   - `test-api-connection.js`: Provides a script to run in the browser console to test the API integration

4. Set up Git repository:
   - Connected to GitHub repository: https://github.com/BoweryJG/linguistics3.git
   - Committed and pushed all changes to the repository

## How to Verify Connection

To verify the frontend is correctly connecting to the backend:

1. Run the backend connection test:
   ```
   node test-backend-connection.js
   ```

2. For testing in the browser environment:
   - Start the application with `npm run dev`
   - Open the browser console (F12)
   - Copy and paste the script from `test-api-connection.js` into the console

## API Connection Details

The API connection is implemented in `src/api.js` with these key features:

- Connection to `https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com` via the VITE_API_URL environment variable
- Automatic CORS proxy fallback if direct connection fails
- Proper error handling with timeouts and retries
- Authentication header inclusion
- Payload formatting according to backend requirements

The connection is working correctly and no further changes should be required.
